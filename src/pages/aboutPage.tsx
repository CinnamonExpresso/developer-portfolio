        <p>
          I’m a mathematics major interested both applied math and the physical sciences. My academic interests include
          Linear Algebra, Calculus, and the general applications of mathematics.

        <p>
          I enjoy approaching problems using intutition rather than relying on outside tools unless it's absolutely needed. Outside of coursework,
          I enjoy writing, building projects, reading (especially on philosophy), and researching.
