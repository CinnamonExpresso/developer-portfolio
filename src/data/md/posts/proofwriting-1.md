Statement: A declaritive sentence that can be either true or false.

Conjecture: When we make a guess in mathematics

## Closure Properties

- Closed under addition
- Closed under multiplication (this can imply clousre under division as well, because division is multiplication with fractions)
- Closed under subtraction

## Types of numbers

- Real numbers: denoted as $$\real$$, for a set of all real numbers. Real numbers consist of rational and irrational numbers.
- Rational numbers: denoted as $$\mathbb{Q}$$ real numbers that can be written as a quotient of two intergers (with a nonzero denominator).
- irrational numbers: denoted as $$\mathbb{Q}$$ real numbers that cannnot be written as a quotient of two intergers (with a nonzero denominator).
- Nautral numbers: denoted as $$\N$$, basically all counting numbers.
- Intergers: denoted as $$\Z$$. consists of all natural and whole numbers with the inclusion of negatives.
