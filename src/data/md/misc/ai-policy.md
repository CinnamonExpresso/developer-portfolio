## My view on "Ai" content
I do not support the use and development of Large Language Models (e.g LLM) in mathematical, engineering, artistic, commercial, and consumer related applications. As such, everything on this website was written, maintained, developed, programmed, and designed by one person; I aim to keep it as such. I will never under any circumstances use Ai for anything on here. 

## Stance regarding the development of Ai and LLM systems
None of the content that I personally created on here can be used to aid in the development of LLM systems or other "Ai" applications without my expressed written consent.
